### We are getting married!

Welcome to our wedding!

Here on the website you can now register for the wedding and soon there
will also be more exciting things and important info about the wedding, so
do not miss to check back here again soon.

### Our story
Our journey together began at the end of 2018 when we traveled together to
Norway to both participate in TV. We did not know each other since before
but our conversations flowed and it became quite clear that we were inspired
by talking to each other. The days in the TV studio were intense so it was not
until on the way home that the conversations deepened and we could see
more of each other. It became clear to both of us that we had a common
longing. We longed for more of Jesus' presence and to see Him for who He
really is. This longing led us closer to each other and we began to make
more contact with each other, a contact that grew stronger in the spring. The
summer passed and the longing for each other grew. Thoughts about
opening up our hearts for each other caught up with us and on October 13
we became a couple. On July 19 last year, Mikael went down on his knees at
the Cross in Hassela and Victoria said yes. Now we long to become husband
and wife.
